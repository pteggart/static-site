  <p id = "video-one">
    A short study, good as a warmup piece: tremolo, arpeggio patterns, A-M-I rest strokes.<br>
    Filmed with my Canon T5i and a prime lens - the Pentax 28mm f2.8.<br><br>
    It was challenging to ensure decent focus with the only option being to manually <br>
    focus, since the Pentax negates and auto-focus capabilities in the Canon body.<br><br>
    First time actually trying to hit a decent exposure level with low ISO,<br>
    as well as white balance and color correcting in Premiere. <br>
    Much to learn.

  <p id = "video-two">
    One slow movement from Antonio Jose's guitar sonata. Filming this video was in part,<br>
    a practice exercise for the ARCT conservatory performance exam. <br><br>
    This is my ARCT List D selection.
    Video shoot location is in the Carnevale residence in Oakville, ON. <br>
    This room specifically reverberated much nicer than the carpeted basement chosen initially.<br><br>
    Filmed on the Canon T5i with the Pentax 28mm f2.8 prime lens. Color correction performed,
    this time<br><br> <i>without</i> flux operating (changing display color temperature).<br><br>
    It would be great to set up a second camera for alternate angles. One step at a time.

  <p id = "video-three">
    A fun piece by Napoleon Coste with a drawn out and serene introduction setion. <br>
    Followed by a playful and exciting scherzo movement. <br><br>
    Different microphone placement, further away, more addded reverb effect. <br><br>
    This video was shot and created without much thought for the color correction <br>
    or white balancing, yet I am still happy with how it turned out.

  <p id = "video-four">
    Bach prelude from BWV 997. A fun piece that I always wanted to learn.<br>
    I omitted the Gigue and Double as this was an initial foray into recording, <br>
    and this felt sufficient for a first project.<br><br>
    The three movements comprised the list A selection for the Grade 10 RCM exam. <br><br>
    As you can see, no color correction or proper white balancing was done. Auto focus <br>
    remained on, likely on face-tracking mode, and was continuously re-focusing. <br><br>
    Great to see some progress made on the production front when looking back at this video.
